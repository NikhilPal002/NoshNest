# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

"NoshNest" is a creative combination of two words:

Nosh: A Yiddish word that has been adopted into English, meaning to eat or snack.
Nest: A place of comfort, security, or a cozy place where something is kept.
Together, "NoshNest" suggests a comfortable and cozy place to find or enjoy food, implying that the food delivery service provides a convenient and delightful experience for its customers.
